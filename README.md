# Project Title

Distance-Amplified Power-law Distributions Better
Characterize Human Long-Distance Travel

## Getting Started

### Environment and Dependencies

* Python version 3.11.3.
* Jupyter notebook
* Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, Datetime, Random, Math, nbimporter

### Datasets

1. MiD 2017: MiD2017_Wege.csv 
   * Mobility in Germany survey (MiD) data which was conducted in the year 2017
2. Nhts 2017: trippub_2017NHTS.csv
   * the American National Household Travel survey (NHTS)data, it collects on travel behavior in the United States
* Note: the above datasets are used in the long-distance and short-distance modelling scripts. The NHTS data is publicly available at https://nhts.ornl.gov/downloads directly. The MiD data needs to be requested via form at https://daten.clearingstelle-verkehr.de/order-form.html#223.
3. UK data: UK_data.csv


### Executing program

* Download the scripts and dataset folder, open it in the Juypter notebook.
* Note: Please note the file paths used in the script and change them to suit your situation.
* Note: Although the original raw dataset is not provided due to privacy concerns, the results folder contains all the pre-processed output files, which can be used for part of the visualizations.
* Note: The folder sir-simulation contains scripts used to simulate the SIR model on a random geometric graph built upon points generated on a play field. Please fined more details in the readme file located in that ordner.
